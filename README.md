# eionet2-azure-jobs

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/eea/eionet2-azure-jobs)](https://github.com/eea/eionet2-azure-jobs/releases)



## Getting started

The application is build as a JavaScript application that is scheduled to be executed automatically at the designated interval through Azure (like a "cron" job).
When a meeting is processed the applications retrieves the meeting participants using Graph API automatically, prepares the ouptput data and store it in SharePoint. The application exchanges data with the EEA Azure tenant to match the users with their Eionet specific information stored in SharePoint.
The output information is used for various reports, such as Eionet dashboard and statistics.

## Configuration file.

The application has a .env file that needs to configured locally. See the details below for file structure:

    # After registering the app in Azure (App registrations) fill the fields below with appropiate values
    TENANT_ID= 
    CLIENT_ID=
    # Generate Client Secret. This is the "value" of the secret
    CLIENT_SECRET=
    # Endpoints
    AAD_ENDPOINT=https://login.microsoftonline.com
    GRAPH_ENDPOINT=https://graph.microsoft.com
    SHAREPOINT_SITE_ID= # Site ID of the -EXT-EionetConfiguration Site - with the lists
    SECONDARY_SHAREPOINT_SITE_ID=  # Site ID of the site with the Individual consultation lists -EXT-Eionet
    CONFIGURATION_LIST_ID= # The configuration list ID, stored in the -EXT-EionetConfiguration Site

The second part of the file will contain the keys of the jobs that are configured to run in the format {Key}=true if the job should run or {Key}=false otherwise. A key must be present only once. Removing the key has the same effect as setting it to false. The keys can be found in the Jobs sections below.

    RUN_MEETING_ATTENDANCE_JOB=true 
    RUN_USER_NAMES_JOB=false 
    RUN_SIGN_IN_USERS_JOB=true
